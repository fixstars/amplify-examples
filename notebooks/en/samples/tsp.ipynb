    "## Formulation of the Traveling Salesman Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "[The Traveling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) is a combinatorial optimization problem to find the shortest route that visits all cities exactly once, given a set of cities and the distances between each pair of cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "![240px-GLPK_solution_of_a_travelling_salesman_problem.svg.png](attachment:3d4196f6-b79c-4fc1-b924-1668e1f7f543.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use the Ising machine, the combinations of paths need to be represented by polynomials with respect to binary or Ising variables.\n",
    "Every combination of paths can be represented by a table of variables that shows which city is visited in which order.\n",
    "For example, the following table for four cities will represent the route $A \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow D$.\n",
    "\n",
    "| turn| A | B | C | D |\n",
    "|-----|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| 1st | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| 2nd | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 3rd | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| 4th | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "\n",
    "We assign binary variables $\\left\\{0, 1\\right\\}$ to each element of the table.\n",
    "We interpret a path by following the cities where $1$ is assigned in the right order from 1st to 4th.\n",
    "That is, for a traveling salesman problem in $N$ cities, it suffices to have $N^2$ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote each variable in the above table as $q_{n,i}$ using the route order $n$ and the city index $i$. Then all the distances of the travel routes are represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    " \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}{\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}{\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}{ d_{ij} q_{n, i} q_{n+1, j} }}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$d_{ij}$ is the distance traveled between cities labeled by $i$ and $j$. Since $d_{ij} q_{n, i} q_{n+1, j}$ adds $d_{ij}$ when both variables equal $1$, the problem is to minimize the total distance traveled. Note that the indices start at $0$ for convenience in later programmatic coding. Also, the end of $n+1$ ( $N$ ) returns to the starting point, so we will take the remainder in $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not a sufficient formulation. This is because the above variable table does not take into account the constraints of \"visiting all cities\" and \"visiting only one city at a time\". As an extreme example, the combination of not moving from the first city is allowed. We thus need to impose the following constraints on all the rows and columns of the variables table.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}{q_{n, i}} = 1 \\quad n \\in \\left\\{0, 1, \\cdots, N - 1 \\right\\}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "    \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}{q_{n, i}} = 1 \\quad i \\in \\left\\{0, 1, \\cdots, N - 1 \\right\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These imply the constraints that $1$ can appear only once in each row and each column of the variable table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarizing the above, it turns out that we need to find the minimum value of the following polynomial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objective function\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}{\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}{\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}{ d_{ij} q_{n, i} q_{n+1, j} }}}\n",

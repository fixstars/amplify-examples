The use of auxiliary variables is not necessarily a bad thing. Still it is better not to use them if possible, so we will consider formulating the problem differently.\n",

    "(Problem ☆) : For each clause of the 3-SAT problem, mark only one literal that appears in the clause (see the following logical formula). Can you do so so that a logical variable $x_i$ and its negation $\\bar{x_i}$ do not appear in the $M$ literals you have marked?\n",

When $x_i$ is marked, $x_i = 1$, and when $\\bar{x_i }$ is marked, $x_i = 0$. If no $x_i$ or $\\bar{x_i}$ is marked, $x_i$ can be either $0$ or $1$.\n",

    "It is easy to see that the logical variable $x$ determined in this way is a solution to the 3-SAT problem.\n",

    "# Home Energy Management\n",
    "\n",
    "A Home Energy Management System (HEMS) is designed to monitor, control, and optimize a household's energy source and usage. When a home has access to multiple energy supplies—such as grid electricity, solar power, battery storage, electric vehicle (EV), or backup generators—HEMS can intelligently decide which source to draw energy from to maximize efficiency, minimize costs, and reduce environmental impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "A HEMS considers time-varying features of these energy sources, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Grid electricity: real-time pricing (RTP) of electricity (USD/kWh)\n",
    "- Battery storage: battery capacity (kWh) and maximum input/output (kW)\n",
    "- Electric vehicle: battery capacity (kWh), maximum input (kW), and ready time\n",
    "- Solar power: variation of supply due to weather (sunshine hours)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example program, we optimize the energy supply mix of the above-mentioned sources using Fixstars Amplify. The present optimization aims to minimize energy costs. However, you can also add an objective to reduce CO2 emissions or other energy sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem setting\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform energy mix optimization, we need to provide the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demand\n",

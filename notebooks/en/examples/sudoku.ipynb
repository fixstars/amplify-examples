    "[Sudoku](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%95%B0%E7%8B%AC) is a puzzle that fills a $9\\times9$ grid with the numbers from $1$ to $9$ accordingly to the following [rules](https://www.nikoli.co.jp/ja/puzzles/sudoku/):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Place one number from $1$ to $9$ to each cell.\n",
    "* No identical numbers may be placed in each row and column, and in each of the nine $3\\times3$ subgrids.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we are given initial clues, where 17 or more numbers are placed (it has been proven that no solution can be found with 16 or less clues). The game is played by determining the numbers that go into the unfilled cells accordingly to the rules above. When the game's difficulty level is low, it is relatively easy to determine which numbers to place. As the difficulty of the game increases, and it requires some experience to solve the puzzles.\n",

    "## Formulation of constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to express Sudoku constraints on annealing machines\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we consider how to express the constraint conditions that correspond to the Sudoku rules, using binary variables whose values are $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules to be expressed are the followings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each row contains the digits from $1$ to $9$ without overlap.\n",
    "2. Each column contains the digits $1$ to $9$ without overlap.\n",
    "3. Each $3\\times3$ subgrid contains the digits $1$ to $9$ without overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without imposing the above rules 1-3, $9$ possible numbers can be placed in each of $9\\times9=81$ cells.\n",
    "We thus consider assigning $9$ binary variables to each of the cells, so that $9\\times9\\times9=729$ variables are prepared in total.\n",
    "One way to describe this situation is that we stack $9$ layers of $9\\times9=81$ grids, so that each layer corresponds to the numbers from $1$ to $9$, respectively.\n",
    "For the $9\\times9=81$ grid in each layer, we let $i$ and $j$ be the indices expressing the rows and columns, respectively, with $i,j=0,\\cdots,8$, corresponding to $1, \\cdots, 9$ th row and column.\n",
    "We also assign the layer index $k=0,\\dots,8$, so that the layer specified by the index corresponds to numbers $1,\\cdots,9$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this observation, we can express the binary variables by $q_{i,j,k}$, where $i,j,k=0,\\cdots,8$ correspond to the indices for rows, columns, and layers, respectively.\n",
    "For example, $q_{2,4,6}=1$ means that number $7$ is placed in the cell at the 3rd row and 5th column, and $q_{2,4,6}=0$ means that $7$ is not to be placed here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these variables, the constraints 1-3 can be written as the following one-hot constraints, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left\\{\n",
    "    \\begin{align}\n",

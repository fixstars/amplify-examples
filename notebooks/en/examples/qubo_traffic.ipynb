    "# Traffic Signal Optimization - Implementation Based on QUBO Formulation\n",

    "Traffic congestion is considered a significant social problem from the economic and environmental conservation perspective. In this example program, we consider real-time control of traffic signals according to the ever-changing traffic conditions to minimize traffic congestion in cities. We consider such traffic light control a combinatorial optimization problem based on the [QUBO formulation](https://amplify.fixstars.com/en/demo/1-tutorial-combinatorial-optimization) and simulate traffic volumes.\n",

    "* There are traffic lights at each intersection to control north-south and east-west traffic at different times of the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is no outflow or inflow of vehicles to the outside of the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "* At all intersections, the percentage of cars going straight, turning right, or turning left is constant (i.e., no specific origin or destination for each car).\n",

    "Based on the above simplification, this example program implements optimal control of signals based on the following three policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improve the flow of cars  \n",
    "\n",
    "    In this case, we define the state of \"good car flow\" as \"at each intersection, there is a slight bias between the number of cars coming from the north/south and the number of vehicles coming from the east/west.\n",

    "2. Keep signal colors the same as long as possible.\n",

    "In this example program, we introduced real-time traffic light control based on combinatorial optimization for simplified urban traffic and performed traffic simulations for such control. The simplification assumes a constant ratio of cars going straight and turning left and right at all intersections. However, based on historical traffic data, the ratio can be set for each intersection and at each time of day to perform more realistic traffic light control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in the present case, we performed real-time traffic light control in response to ever-changing traffic conditions. Using black-box optimization, it is also possible to realize statistically optimal traffic light control based on past traffic observation data (or simulation results). An example program for such black-box optimization is described [here](https://amplify.fixstars.com/en/demo/fmqa_4_traffic)."

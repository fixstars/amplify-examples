The key here is the following model, called the optimal speed model ([Bando et al., Jpn. J. Ind. Appl. Math. (1994)](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF03167222); [Bando et al., Phys. Rev.

    "We will now introduce the MAS-based traffic simulator `TrafficSimulator2Malls` that we will use here. The city considered in this simulator is a city with a simple shape consisting of `city_size`$\\times$`city_size` blocks, with roads in a grid pattern between the blocks. All intersections have traffic lights, meaning we can control traffic signals installed at `city_size`$\\times$`city_size` intersections. The city has two popular shopping malls, and we likely see heavy traffic locally around these malls. To simplify the problem, the boundaries surrounding the city are periodic (e.g., what goes out of the city from the left comes in from the right).\n",

    "Now, we use the black-box optimization class `FMQA` implemented in [Section 2](#2) to optimize the control of the traffic light network installed in the target city. Here, the objective function is the negative value of the average speed of all vehicles predicted by the MAS traffic simulator ([Section 1](#1)). Since the optimization proceeds to minimize the objective function value, we expect that the optimized traffic light control will maximize the average vehicle speed of all vehicles. We can obtain the average vehicle speed in the simulation after the simulation with `get_latest_mean()`. For each objective function evaluation during the optimization process, `n_cases` simulation cases with randomly determined initial conditions (departure and destination locations) are considered, and the objective function returns the average value as the objective function value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, due to the [runtime limit](#env) in the demo/tutorial environment, the number of times that we can evaluate the objective function $N$ is 3, of which $N_0$ is 2 for generating the initial data (thus, a total of $N-N_0=1$ optimization cycle). \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the limited number of optimization cycles ($N - N_0 = 1$) may not always find a better solution than the initial data corresponding to a random search, you can see how the entire optimization progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform optimization properly considering a sufficient number of cycles, please [download the sample code](#env) and run optimization in a local environment after increasing the number of evaluations of the objective function $N$ (our demo/tutorial environment limits the runtime up to 20 minutes). For example, for $N=100$, you can achieve an average vehicle speed of about 8 m/s at the end of the optimization process. In this case, it takes about 2-3 hours for the entire optimization cycle to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example output for $N_0=100$ and a simulation animation comparing traffic simulation results with/without optimal traffic light control are shown in \"[3.4\\. Example of Execution with this Sample Code](#3_4)\"."

For example, for a $N=100$ condition, the average vehicle speed with the traffic light control pattern obtained in the black-box optimization is about 25% higher than the average speed with the best traffic light control obtained in the random search process (initial training data construction shown in blue).\n",

    "In this example program, we performed optimization based on objective function values obtained from MAS traffic simulations. In actual signal control optimization, it may be more realistic to perform optimization based on daily traffic condition measurements rather than based on simulations. A DevOps-like operation method that performed optimization while operating the system can be considered in this case. In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change the traffic light control appropriately and acquire $N_0$ days of data (the set of control parameters and objective function values).  \n",
    "   (Or, use $N_0$ days of data measured in the past)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Perform one cycle of black-box optimization based on $N_0$ data sets to obtain new (hopefully better) control parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Based on the new control parameters, control the traffic lights the next day and measure the objective function values. We add the measurement results (control parameters and objective function values) to the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Perform one cycle of black-box optimization based on the added data set and obtain new (hopefully even better) control parameters.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the objective function value does not necessarily have to be the negative value of the average vehicle speed used in this sample program --- a more easily measured value, such as the negative value of the number of vehicles entering certain intersections per unit time, can be used to perform similar optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on such an optimization flow, as shown in \"[3.4\\. Example output from this FMQA sample program](#history)\", the traffic situation is expected to improve day by day in an average sense. However, there are days when the optimization suggests control parameters with poor performance. This mechanism prevents the optimization from falling into a local optimum solution and is an unavoidable event in adopting this black-box optimization method. However, after a sufficient number of optimization cycles, we expect that the likelihood of obtaining such poorly performing control parameters will decrease. The following optimization history performed under $N=400$ conditions suggests the same.\n",

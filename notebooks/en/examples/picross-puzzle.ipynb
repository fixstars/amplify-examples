    "1. Use a set of binary variables $q^\\text{row}$ to represent board layouts that satisfy the row (left-side) hints.\n",
    "2. Use another set of binary variables $q^\\text{col}$ to represent board layouts that satisfy the column (top) hints.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Representation of Boards Satisfying Row Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent a board that satisfies the row hints by assigning numbers to certain squares, as shown in the diagram below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../figures/picross-puzzle/5x5_numbered.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In each row, numbers $0, 1, \\ldots$ are written from left to right on the leftmost square of each consecutive block of black squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing this operation, the following rules must be satisfied for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the hints for a row are $h_0, h_1, \\ldots, h_{n-1}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The numbers $0$ to $n-1$ must each appear exactly once in that row.\n",

    "\n",
    "![](../figures/picross-puzzle/row_constraint.drawio.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up Row Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We use binary variables to represent the numbers written in each square. For each square, we prepare several binary variables equal to the number of hints for that row. If the $i$-th variable is 1, it means the number $i$ is written in that square. For example, in the second row of the figure above, there are two hints. The number 0 is in the second square from the left, and the number 1 is in the fourth square. This can be represented using a $5 \\times 2$ table of binary variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Square \\ Number      | Number 0 | Number 1 |\n",
    "| -------------------- | -------- | -------- |\n",
    "| 1st square from left | 0        | 0        |\n",

    "| 5th square from left | 0        | 0        |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this table, both variables for the first square are 0, which means no number is written in this square. For the second square, the variable representing \"Number 0\" is 1, which means zero is written there.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, we set up (number of columns) $\\times$ (number of hints for that row) binary variables for each row. We'll use $q^\\text{row}_{i,j,k}$ for the binary variable that represents whether number $k$ is written in the square at row $i$, column $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to add constraints to $q^\\text{row}_{i,j,k}$ to ensure it correctly represents a board that satisfies the row hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a square can have at most one number written on it, or none at all; it cannot have two. This means that for each square, at most one of its corresponding binary variables (one for each hint) can be 1. In equation form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\sum_k q^\\text{row}_{i,j,k} \\leq 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we add conditions for each row to ensure it satisfies its hints.\n",
    "Assume the hints for a row are $h_0, h_1, \\ldots, h_{n-1}$. As mentioned earlier, the following three rules must hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The numbers $0$ to $n-1$ must each appear exactly once in that row.\n",
    "- For $0 \\leq k < n-1$, the square with the number $k+1$ must be at least $h_k + 1$ squares to the right of the square with the number $k$.\n",
    "- The square with the number $n-1$ cannot be to the right of the $h_{n-1}$-th square from the right edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, \"The numbers $0$ to $n-1$ must each appear exactly once in that row.\" In our binary variable table, this means the sum of each \"Number\" column must be 1. For each $k$ from $0$ to $n-1$, only one variable representing $k$ being written in that row should be 1. In equation form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\sum_j q^\\text{row}_{i,j,k} = 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, \"For $0 \\leq k < n-1$, the square with number $k+1$ must be at least $h_k + 1$ squares to the right of the square with number $k$.\" This is a constraint for all but the last hint number. We can rephrase this as: \"We cannot have number $k$ in column $j_1$ AND number $k+1$ in column $j_2$ if $j_2 - j_1 < h_k+1$.\" In equation form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  q^\\text{row}_{i,j_1,k} q^\\text{row}_{i, j_2, k+1} = 0 \\quad (j_2 - j_1 < h_k + 1,\\ \\text{$h_k$ is the $k$-th hint for row $i$})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, \"The square with number $n-1$ cannot be to the right of the $h_{n-1}$-th square from the right edge.\" This is a constraint for the last hint number in each row. In equation form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  q^\\text{row}_{i, j, n-1} = 0 \\quad (j > (\\text{number of columns}) - h_{n-1})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, if $q^\\text{row}$ satisfies all these conditions, it will be a valid representation of a board satisfying the row hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representation of Boards Satisfying Column Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply the same approach for the column hints. We define binary variables $q^\\text{col}$, this time setting up (number of rows) $\\times$ (number of hints) variables for each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "A board satisfying the column hints would look like this for the example given earlier:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../figures/picross-puzzle/5x5_numbered_col.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We use $q^\\text{col}_{j, i, k}$ for the variable that represents the number $k$ being written in the square at row $i$, column $j$. Note that the column index $j$ comes first.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add the same types of constraints for $q^\\text{col}$ to ensure it represents a valid board for the column hints. Simply refer to the previous section, swapping \"row\" for \"column\" and \"left\" for \"top.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraint for Matching Boards\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to add constraints to ensure that the two sets of binary variables, $q^\\text{row}$ and $q^\\text{col}$, describe the same colored board.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's consider how to reconstruct the board (which squares are colored) from the $q^\\text{row}$ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a row's hints are `2 1 2`, a square in that row is colored black if it meets any of the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number 0 is written in that square or one square to its left.\n",
    "- Number 1 is written in that square.\n",
    "- Number 2 is written in that square or one square to its left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the constraints we have already set on $q^\\text{row}$, these conditions cannot overlap. Therefore, if the hint for row $i$ is `2 1 2`, the square at row $i$, column $j$ is black if the following expression is 1, and white if it is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "q^\\text{row}_{i, j, 0} + q^\\text{row}_{i, j-1, 0} + q^\\text{row}_{i, j, 1} + q^\\text{row}_{i, j, 0} + q^\\text{row}_{i, j-1, 0}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with different hint numbers, we can find a similar linear expression of $q^\\text{row}$ for each square's color. In general, if the hints for row $i$ are $h_0, h_1, \\ldots$, the color of the square at row $i$, column $j$ ($C^\\text{row}_{i,j}$) is black if the value is 1, and white if 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C^\\text{row}_{i,j} = \\displaystyle\\sum_k \\sum_{r=j-h_k+1}^j q^\\text{row}_{i,r,k}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do the same for $q^\\text{col}$. If the hints for column $j$ are $H_0, H_1, \\ldots$, the color of the square at row $i$, column $j$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C^\\text{col}_{i,j} = \\displaystyle\\sum_k \\sum_{r=i-H_k+1}^j q^\\text{col}_{j,r,k}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to make the boards match, we simply need to add a constraint that $C^\\text{row}{i,j} = C^\\text{col}_{i,j}$ for every square $(i, j)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_k \\sum_{r=j-h_k+1}^j q^\\text{row}_{i,r,k} = \\sum_k \\sum_{r=i-H_k+1}^j q^\\text{col}_{j,r,k}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This constraint ensures that the board reconstructed from $q^\\text{row}$ and the board from $q^\\text{col}$ are the same.\n",
    "\n",

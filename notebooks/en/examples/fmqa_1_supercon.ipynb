    "# Black-Box Optimization of Model Superconducting Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the effective use of black-box optimization, this sample code describes the optimization for superconducting materials composed of pseudo-materials as an example problem. Although the present sample code performs material searches based on nonlinear algebraic models, you can perform black-box optimization with the same steps based on high-precision simulations or experimental measurement results instead of model algebraic expressions. Even in such cases, you can use this example almost as is.\n",

    "\n",
    "Superconductivity technology is expected to be utilized in the fields of transportation, such as maglev trains, metrology, and energy. Various superconducting materials are currently being developed to realize superconductivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The temperature at which superconductivity is achieved (critical temperature) is generally around the absolute temperature of 0 K (Kelvin) for currently confirmed superconducting materials. Because of this, superconductivity requires costly cooling to be exploited, and its application in the real world is currently limited. Therefore, the search for high-temperature superconductors is a pressing issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the search for materials that realize superconductivity involves a trial-and-error process of selecting and synthesizing several materials, repeatedly evaluating the critical temperature of the synthesized materials by measurement, and identifying the material to be synthesized that achieves a higher critical temperature. This process of synthesis and critical temperature evaluation is considered time-consuming. For this search, a black box optimization method is used to find a combination of materials close to the optimal solution with a relatively small number of evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the search for superconducting materials consisting of pseudo materials is treated as an example to illustrate the material search by a black-box optimization method (FMQA), and a critical temperature model is used to evaluate the critical temperature. Note that the critical temperature models presented below and the combinations of materials obtained are not necessarily physically accurate, and thus the example serves for illustration purposes only."

    "Suppose there is a set $S$ and given subsets $T_0, T_1, \\ldots, T_{N-1}$ of $S$. The problem of selecting some of $T_0, T_1, \\dots, T_{N-1}$ so that they have no common parts and making the sum of the number of elements of the selected subsets as large as possible is called the **set packing problem**.\n",

In this case, if $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_4$ are chosen, the sum of the number of elements is $8$, which is the maximum. On the other hand, since $T_0$ and $T_1$, for example, have a common part, they cannot be chosen at the same time.\n",

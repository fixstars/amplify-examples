    "Suppose you have $N$ jobs, and you know how long each job will take. There are $M$ machines that can run those jobs, and we assign each of the $N$ jobs to one of the machines. The idea is to find the allocation that gives the fastest time for all jobs to complete.\n",

    "However, each machine executes its assigned jobs serially. That is, a machine cannot have multiple jobs running simultaneously. We also assume that the time taken for each job is an integer.\n",

    "For example, if you have three jobs that take one hour each, and you have two machines, and you assign two jobs to one machine and one job to the other, it will take two hours for all jobs to complete. And since it is impossible to complete all jobs in less than two hours, this is the optimal solution.\n",

    "# Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we consider the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), a type of vehicle routing problem (VRP).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Specific applications include\n",
    "- Delivery scheduling in the postal and other transportation industries\n",
    "- Scheduling in garbage collection and street cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "A vehicle routing problem is a problem of determining efficient delivery routes from a depot to multiple cities. More specifically, the problem determines the allocation of delivery vehicles and cities, and the order in which the cities are visited, to minimize the total distance traveled by the delivery vehicles, the total cost, and so on. The routing problem can be interpreted as a generalization of the [traveling salesperson problem](https://amplify.fixstars.com/en/demo/tsp).\n",
    "\n",
    "The capacitated vehicle routing problem addressed in this tutorial is the above routing problem with an additional load constraint on each vehicle. In other words, each delivery vehicle must satisfy the load constraints while making deliveries --- they cannot carry loads heavier than their payload. This problem can be interpreted as a \"traveling salesperson problem + knapsack problem\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we consider the case where there is only one delivery location (depot), and the demand in each city and the vehicle capacity take only integer values."

Specifically, if $1$ appears in the \"depot\" column except for rows 0 and 9 in the table, it is ignored (considered as $0$).

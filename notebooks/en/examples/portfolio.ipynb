    "# Portfolio Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we consider portfolio optimization.\n",
    "A portfolio is a combination of financial instruments such as stocks and bonds.\n",
    "Unlike bank deposits, these financial instruments are risky assets with uncertain future payouts and returns.\n",
    "When investing in such risky assets, it is advisable to construct an appropriate portfolio and diversify investment across assets that are not highly correlated.\n",
    "In this way, if the value of one asset falls significantly, it can be covered by another asset that is not significantly correlated with its price.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, diversified investment involve a trade-off between risk and return.\n",
    "Portfolios must be constructed to properly reflect this trade-off, limiting return variability and risk of loss while maximizing return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will use Fixstars Amplify to optimize the portfolio.\n",
    "The optimization uses estimates based on the historical data method.\n",
    "The historical data method is an estimation method that uses historical price data to determine assets' expected returns and risks.\n",
    "In this sample program, we will explain as follows\n",

    "- [Obtain historical data](#1)\n",

    "# Portfolio Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we consider portfolio optimization.\n",
    "A portfolio is a combination of financial instruments such as stocks and bonds.\n",
    "Unlike bank deposits, these financial instruments are risky assets with uncertain future payouts and returns.\n",
    "When investing in such risky assets, it is advisable to construct an appropriate portfolio and diversify investments across assets that are not highly correlated.\n",
    "In this way, if the value of one asset falls significantly, it can be covered by another asset that is not significantly correlated with its price.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, diversified investment involve a trade-off between risk and return.\n",
    "Portfolios must be constructed to properly reflect this trade-off, limiting return variability and risk of loss while maximizing return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will use Fixstars Amplify to optimize the portfolio.\n",
    "The optimization uses estimates based on the historical data method.\n",
    "The historical data method is an estimation method that uses historical price data to determine assets' expected returns and risks.\n",
    "In this sample program, we will explain the following:\n",

    "First, we create time series data of stock prices. We prepared dummy simulation data (`dummy_stock_price.csv`) based on geometric Brownian motion. In the simulation, the parameters of the stochastic differential equation are determined so that the distribution of profit rate, volatility (risk), and correlation coefficient among stocks matches the price movements of each stock in the NASDAQ index from 2023 to the first half of 2024 as much as possible. Please refer to the end of this tutorial to learn how to obtain real data.\n",

    "## Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "We are ready to obtain time series data on stock prices. Now, we formulate the formulation to achieve the optimal portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we pick up the candidate stocks to invest in.\n",
    "Suppose that we choose $n$ financial instruments: financial instrument $0$, $1$, $\\ldots$, and financial instrument $n -1$.\n",
    "Let $w_i$ (%) be the ratio of investment in financial instrument $i$ to the total investment amount, the constraint that $w_i$ must satisfy the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w_i = 100\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the convenience of optimization using Amplify, $w_i$ is assumed to be an integer value.\n",
    "Also, since investing a large percentage in a single financial instrument is risky, we limit the percentage invested in a single financial instrument to 20% or less of the total amount invested.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "0 \\leq w_i \\leq 20\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Some ways exist to create a portfolio from these $n$ candidate financial instruments.\n",
    "Among them, we consider a “good portfolio” with a high expected rate of return and low risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, for the expected rate of return, we will simply adopt the average rate of return for any $d$ business day in the stock price data when operated during that period.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a stock is invested for a certain period of time, the value at the beginning is $p_{s}$, and the value at the end is $p_{e}$, and the rate of return $r$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r = (p_{e} - p_{s}) / p_{s}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected rate of return on the entire portfolio $r_p$ is obtained by the following equation with the rate of return on financial instrument $i$ $r_i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_p = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} r_i w_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If other indicators can provide a better numerical assessment of expected return (or “goodness” of a stock), you can use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we consider risk.\n",
    "Risk in diversified investments is usually the variance of the total portfolio rate of return $\\sigma^2_p$, which can be described using the covariance of the rates of return of financial instruments $i$ and $j$ $\\sigma_{i,j}$ as the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma_p^2 = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_i w_j \\sigma_{i,j}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now defined the rate of return and risk.\n",
    "To make the rate of return $r_p$ larger and the risk $\\sigma_p^2$ smaller, the following mean and variance model $f(w_i)$ is used as the objective function and optimized to minimize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(w_i) = - r_p + \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\sigma_p^2.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\gamma$ is a parameter related to the balance between rate of return and risk.\n",
    "The portfolio optimization implemented below uses $\\gamma=20$ as the default setting. Larger $\\gamma$ means more emphasis is placed on risk reduction.\n"

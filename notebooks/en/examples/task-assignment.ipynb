    "# Employee Assignment Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal assignment of employees to stores is an important task for retail and service industries with a large number of employees. Typically, such assignment processes must take into account each employee's position, skills, and preferred work location, as well as a variety of daily-changing tasks in each store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we address the combinatorial optimization problem of employee assignment, using a restaurant chain as an example. In particular, we aim to assign employees appropriately according to position, skill type and level, position, and desired work location.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an employee may have the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Position**\n",
    "- Store manager\n",
    "- Assistant manager\n",
    "- Staff (no position)\n",

    "  - A la carte dish preparation skill\n",

    "  - Type and level of culinary skills required\n",

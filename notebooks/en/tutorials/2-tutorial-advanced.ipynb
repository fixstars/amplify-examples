    "In the optimization problems that we have dealt with so far in this tutorial, there is no limit to the values that the decision variables can take, and we searched for the value that minimizes the objective function among all possible combinations of values that the decision variables can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in a general optimization problem, there are cases where optimal solutions must be sought from the decision variables satisfying certain conditions.\n",
    "This kind of problem is called a constrained optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an example of a constrained optimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Objective function $x_1 + x_2$\n",
    "* Constraint $x_1 + x_2 \\geq 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the inequality constraints mentioned above, there are other examples such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Equality constraint ($x_1 + x_2 = 1$)\n",
    "* Boolean constraint \n",
    "  * NAND constraint (binary variables $x_1, x_2$ can never both be 1)\n",
    "  * OR constraint (at least one of the binary variables $x_1, x_2$ is 1)\n",

    "When constraints are imposed, it is necessary to find the optimal solution from the \"feasible solutions\" that satisfy the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the QUBO and Ising models cannot handle constraints.\n",
    "Therefore, when solving constrained optimization problems by attributing them to QUBO, it is necessary to express the constraints as parts of the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic approach is to add a penalty function $g$ to the original objective function $f$ with weights such that it takes the minimum value if the constraints are satisfied.\n",
    "By finding the optimal solution for $h = f + \\lambda g\\quad (\\lambda \\gt 0)$ instead of $f$, it is possible to obtain a feasible solution that minimizes the penalty function $g$, i.e., satisfies the constraints.\n",
    "In practice, the obtained solution is not necessarily the optimal solution, so we identify whether it is a feasible solution by checking if the solution of $h$ is the minimum value when evaluated with $g$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this equality constraint can be expressed using the following penalty function\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_1 + x_2 = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$g(\\mathbf{x}) = (x_1 + x_2 - 1)^2$\n",

When q that does not satisfy the constraints is input, a \"penalty\" is imposed such that the function takes a value larger than the minimum value, so $g(\\mathbf{q})$ is called a penalty function.

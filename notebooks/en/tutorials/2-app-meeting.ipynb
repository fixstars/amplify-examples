    "The meeting room assignment problem is a problem of assigning meeting rooms so that as many meetings as possible can be held, given multiple meeting schedules and multiple meeting rooms. In this task, we construct a QUBO model for this problem and try to solve the problem using an annealing machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, assume that the start and end times of each meeting are given as data. Here, the time is given as a string in the format `\"10:40\"`. In addition, we will have a dictionary of meeting schedule information with the meeting name as the key and the list of start and end times of the meeting as the value. We will also define the number of meetings and the number of available meeting rooms."

    "## Number Division Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "As a concrete example of a combinatorial optimization problem, let's consider the number partitioning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that the set of $n$ integers $A$ is given as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \\{a_0, a_1, \\cdots, a_{n-1} \\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the division of $A$ into two sets $A_0$ and $A_1$. The following problems are considered to be the number division problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision problem: Determine if there exists a partition of a set such that the sum of the elements of $A_0$ is equal to the sum of the elements of $A_1$.\n",
    "* Optimization problem: Find the partition of the set that minimizes the difference between the sum of the elements of $A_0$ and the sum of the elements of $A_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the partition of the set of 10 integers $A=\\{2,10,3,8,5,7,9,5,3,2\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we divide the set as $A_0=\\{2,3,5,7,10\\}, A_1=\\{2,3,5,8,9\\}$, we can check that the sum of the elements of each set is equal.\n",
    "Therefore, the answer is \"exists\" for a decision problem, and the above $A_0, A_1$ is the answer for an optimization problem.\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "q_i &\\in\\{0, 1\\}\\quad (i=0, 1, \\cdots, n-1) \\quad \\text{(Binary)}\\\\\n",

    "The objective function is a function of the above binary or Ising variables, such that it takes the minimum value if the conditions to be sought are satisfied.\n",
    "Here, in order to find a partition that satisfies the condition $S_0 = S_1$, we set the objective function as $(S_1 - S_0)^2$. When this condition is satisfied, the objective function becomes $0$ and takes the minimum value.\n",

    "&= \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(2q_i -1)a_i\\right)^2 \\quad \\text{(Binary)}\\\\\n",

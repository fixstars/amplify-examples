    "## Formulation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use black-and-white images here as a simple example. We can make the following assumptions about the relationship between the noisy and denoised images.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The noisy and denoised images have relatively large overlaps.\n",
    "*   In the denoised image, neighboring pixels are likely to have the same color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise reduction is performed by optimizing these conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constants and Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the color of a pixel is black or white, the value of each pixel can be expressed by a variable that takes value $-1$ or $1$.\n",
    "In the following, the black pixel corresponds to $-1$ and the white pixel to $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $y_{ij}$ denote the value corresponding to the color of each pixel in the noisy image.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_{ij} = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "-1 \\quad \\text{(if the corresponding pixel is black)} \\\\\n",
    "+1 \\quad \\text{(if the corresponding pixel is white)}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $s_{ij}$ denote the Ising variable corresponding to the color of each pixel in the denoised image. The denoised image can be obtained by optimizing these Ising variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s_{ij} = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "-1 \\quad \\text{(if the corresponding pixel is black)} \\\\\n",

    "## Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The following two conditions about the denoised image are assumed:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The noisy and denoised images have relatively large overlaps.\n",
    "*   In the denoised image, neighboring pixels are likely to have the same color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us write down these conditions as a polynomial minimization problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, consider the first assumption that the the noisy and denoised images have relatively large overlaps. $-y_{ij}s_{ij} = -1$ if the pixels at the same position (i, j) in the two images match and $-y{ij}s_{ij} = 1$ otherwise. Therefore, the following polynomial $f_1$, which is the summation of the expression by each pixel, takes smaller value if the two images have larger overlaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_1 = \\sum_{i, j} -y_{ij} s_{ij}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, consider the second assumption that neighboring pixels tend to be the same color. $-s_{ij}s_{i'j'} = -1$ if the pixels at the position (i, j) and (i', j') in the denoised image have the same color and $-s_{ij}s_{i'j'} = 1$ otherwise. Therefore, the following polynomial $f_2$, which is the summation of the expression by each pair of neighboring pixels, takes smaller value if the larger number of neighboring pixels have the same color.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_2 = \\sum_{s_{i, j} \\text{and} s_{i', j'} \\text{are adjacent}} -s_{i, j} s_{i', j'}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding these expressions $f_1$ and $f_2$ together with an appropriate weight, the objective function is created, which takes smaller value if the two conditions are satisfied. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f & = f_1 + \\eta f_2\\\\\n",
    "f_1 &= \\sum_{i, j} -y_{ij} s_{ij}, \\\\\n",
    "f_2 &= \\sum_{s_{i, j} \\text{and} s_{i', j'} \\text{are adjacent}} -s_{i, j} s_{i', j'}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have introduced the parameter $\\eta>0$. This allows us to adjust the relative strength of $f_1$ and $f_2$. The larger the value of $\\eta$ is, the stronger the effect of the noise reduction term is.\n",
    "\n",
    "By minimizing this objective function and interpreting the values of the Ising variables $s$ as the values of the pixels, we can obtain an image with reduced noise.\n",
